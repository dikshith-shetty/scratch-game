# 02. High-Level Design (HLD)

## 1. Objective

The Scratch Game CLI application simulates a scratch card game using a configuration file. It randomly generates a symbol matrix, evaluates winning conditions, applies bonus symbols if applicable, and calculates the final reward based on a betting amount.

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

This application follows a modular architecture with the following major components:

- **CLI** â€“ Handles input arguments and output/displays results.
- **ConfigLoader** â€“ Parses and validates the JSON configuration.
- **GameEngine** â€“ Orchestrates the entire game flow.
- **MatrixGenerator** â€“ Creates the matrix based on symbol probabilities.
- **RewardEngine** â€“ Evaluates the matrix and calculates the reward.
- **BonusStrategy** â€“ Applies any bonus logic if a win is detected.

## 4. Component Responsibilities

| Component         | Responsibility                                                                |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CLI`             | Entry point, Reads config path and betting amount from user; calls GameEngine |
| `ConfigLoader`    | Parses `config.json` and maps it to in-memory Java objects                    |
| `GameEngine`      | Coordinates matrix generation, reward evaluation, and final output            |
| `MatrixGenerator` | Fills the matrix with standard symbols based on per-cell probabilities        |
| `RewardEngine`    | Checks win rules; computes reward; invokes bonus strategy if needed           |
| `BonusStrategy`   | Modifies the reward based on bonus symbol impact (e.g., multiply, fixed add)  |

## 9. Assumptions

- `config.json` is always valid 
- Matrix can be non-square (nÃ—m)
- Bonus symbols are placed exactly once, at a random cell
- Symbol selection is pseudo-random based on probability
- Betting amount is fractional and handled using `BigDecimal`
- Output is printed in JSON-like format

---

## 10. Design Decisions

- We used modular service classes to allow extensibility
- Each module has single responsibility
- Separated standard symbol and bonus symbol logic
- Config-driven architecture allows rule and symbol extension without code change
- Tests and coverage are integrated using Maven and JaCoCo
